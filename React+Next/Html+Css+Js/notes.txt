./cat.png -> stay in current directory and search for the file 
../cat.png -> go one level up and search for cat.png

c:user/project/images/cat.png -> absolute path
images/cat.png -> relative path search below from where we are(this is better) 
here is why:👉🏼
even if our project moves to somewhere else in that case absolute path will be change 
but the relative path remaings same
